Incontinents: Landmass generator
================================

This is a somewhat cleaned up undergraduate course project. It generates continents divided into territories for the purpose of playing some sort of board game on it.

Dependencies: PIL, aggdraw, optionally pyglet

    usage: Incontinents [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-n NUM] [-v]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                            Where to store the resulting PNG
      -n NUM, --num NUM     Number of countries in the continent
      -v, --view            Immediately show the continent (requires the pyglet
                            library)

=========================

Q: Why is the code in [file] so awful?

A: Like so many undergraduate course projects, it was written in a frenzy and released Just Because.
